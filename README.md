# Android Suitmedia Mobile Test


## ðŸ“‹ About Project
This project is an assignment for the 2025 Impact Internship Test - Mobile Developer Intern - Suitmedia. This project was completed within 24 hours according to the instructions provided. This report discusses the assignment given, which was to develop an application with several specifications. I chose to create a native mobile application for the Android platform using Kotlin and XML with a minimum SDK of 21 and a target SDK of 34. The application consists of three main screens: name input and palindrome checking, a welcome message screen with user options, and a user list retrieved from an external API. The use of Retrofit for API consumption, View Binding for UI access, and navigation management between screens are discussed in detail. The application layout is customized according to the prototype design in Figma. <img width="468" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3784ec5-6ec3-4079-8cd7-d0d6460bef78" />
